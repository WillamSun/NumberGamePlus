# Number Smash, a simple number game

## Rules
The objective of the game is to select a set of numbers that add up to 0. When the game begins, it will present you with an equation containing 7 numbers. Your goal is to select one or more numbers from the equation that, when added together, equal 0.

To play, simply click on the numbers you want to select. As long as the sum of the selected numbers is 0, you will earn 1 point and the equation will be refreshed with a new set of 7 numbers. If the sum of your selected numbers does not equal 0, you will lose the game.

If you are unable to find a set of numbers that add up to 0, you can click the "Refresh" button to generate a new equation. The game will check if there is a valid solution before refreshing.

To restart the game at any time, click the "Reset" button. You can also click the "Help" button to have the game automatically find a set of numbers that add up to 0.

Additionally, the game includes several optional advanced features that can enhance the experience:

- "Select All" checkbox to instantly select or deselect all numbers
- "Pause" checkbox to pause the game 
- Timer that displays your score and time used
- Options to adjust font size, make the game always on top, show a progress bar, and display the current sum

More options can be found on the menu strip at the top.

There are also several special number types that can be introduced by enabling the "Extended Features Toggle":

- Infinitive (∞) - Can be combined with any other number, but does not count towards your score
- Signum (±) - Represents both positive and negative versions of a number
- Unknown (x) - Allows you to avoid losing a point one time if the sum is not 0
- Double ([×2]) - Doubles your score when used
- Null - Refreshes the equation without resetting the game
- Multiplication of 0 ([×0]) - Same as Infinitive, but counts towards your score

## Releases
